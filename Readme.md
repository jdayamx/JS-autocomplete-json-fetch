# simple-autocomplete-json-fetch
Simple website using HTML CSS and javaScript.
Uses fetch api for asynchronous loading of JSON into the website.

# usage instrcutions
since this project uses fetch() api of json, it needs to run on a server as the browser restricts loading of file locally. ( Error: URL scheme needs to be http or https for CORS request)

Simplest way would be to use the live-server extension in VS Code which is a light weight server inbuilt in VSCode and can be configured to run on desired port.
